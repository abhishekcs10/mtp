Introduction
=============

Number of cores per node is increasing. So we need to simulate multicore processors using today's technologies

Demands on simulation
-----------------------

- Increasing core counts
	
	- Linear increase in simulator workload 
	- Single-threaded simulator sees a rising gap
		- Workload: increasing target cores
		- available processing power: near-constant single-thread performance of host machine
	- Need to use all cores of the host machine
	- Parallel Simulation

- Increasing cache size
	
	- Need a large working set to fully exercise a large cache
	- Scaled-down application won't exhibit the same behaviour
	- Long runnning simulations are required

Experiment Design In Architecture 
--------------------------------------

- Optimizing the probability of success.
	(finding the best architecture/parameters)

	- Coverage:    how    many    architecture    configuraLons    can    I    run    
	- Confidence:  #benchmarks, re‚Äêruns    for    variable    applicaLons    
	- Accuracy:    simulation model detail vs. runtime     


- How many scenarios can i run

	-  N = total number of simulaLon scenarios 	
	-  d = days until paper deadline    
	-  t = average time per simulaLon    
	-  B = number of benchmarks    
	-  A = number of architectures    

.. math:: N = \frac{d}{t*B*A}
